Building on top of [[Integrations with other readers]], we could generalize the injection of the Readup tracker and comment section *to every website with an article*.

In fact, this was the behavior of the [[The original reallyread.it web extension]]: a user's reading activity was tracked and recorded on every page they visited.

This was decommissioned as a privacy nightmare, and it also lead to *a lot* of non-articles being imported (see [[Parser improvements]] and [[The Readup Librarian Role|manual cleanup]]), but some people actually liked it. It could be reintroduced as an opt-in feature.

Some readers liked this feature when considering Readup as a "Fitbit for reading": the core idea of the original Fitbit step counters was that you wear it all day, and let it tally your daily activity. Perhaps to reach a goal, and to share your progress with friends.

Similarly, Readup could be more effective for tallying your reading activity if you didn't have to activate it manually - a step that you might forget.
