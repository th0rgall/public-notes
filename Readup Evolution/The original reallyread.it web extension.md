The first version of Readup (reallyread.it) was a web extension that **only** embedded Readup comments on publisher's article pages. Quoting from [reallyread.it & the future of social media](https://medium.com/matter-driven-narrative/reallyread-it-the-future-of-social-media-3cbba80ebef6), written by Readup co-founder bill on Feb 22, 2018:

> We’re on reallyread.it every day, reading and commenting on articles from our favorite publications like _The New York Times_ and _The Economist_ as well as our favorite blogs from all around the world. Pretty much anything can be read and shared with the community.
> 
> So — how does it work?
> 
> For now, community members add a chrome extension which enables them to track their reading progress and get credit for things they’ve really read. 

**You could only see Readup comments from others if you had the extension installed, visited the same source article URL, and read the whole article.**

Some time later[^1], the shared *Article of the Day* competition on the reallyread.it homepage was built: now there was also a centralized place where the activity of Readup readers was gathered.
