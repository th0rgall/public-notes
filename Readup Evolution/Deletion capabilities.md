Is a table-stakes feature that is surprisingly missing, in some ways, from Readup!

- It is possible to delete a comment you've left.
- It is possible to delete your account.
- It is **not** possible to delete the fact that you've (partly) read article (that is, deleting it from your history). This should probably be possible.
	- But it might lead to complications when you've already posted said article! 
- It is **not** possible for a user to purge an article from Readup's database. It is questionable whether this should even be possible, but it would be good as a clean-up measure reserved for [[The Readup Librarian Role]], especially for non-articles that were wrongly parsed.
