Readup already supports the parsing of topics and tags defined by the publisher on articles (see [[Followable topics]]), but the user can not add tags to articles that they define.

Some form of tags or categories may help users classify what they have read, or what they still want to read, based on criteria they find useful. It is a feature found in many other reading apps.

In a way, Readup's "starring" feature is the only user-controlled tagging system currently available. People can use it as a read-it-later category, or a "favorites" category.
