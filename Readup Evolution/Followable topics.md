Similar to microblogging platforms allowing you to follow hashtags, Readup could enable you to follow certain topics, so you would be notified if a new article in your followed topic was imported to Readup, or, you'd simply see it in your feed.

Readup already extracts and saves topic/tag metadata exposed by websites' semantic data layers.
