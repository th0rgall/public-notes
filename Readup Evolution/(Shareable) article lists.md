... is a feature that I've seen being added to several reading apps. The core idea is that you can compile a reading list of articles, which can then be shared.

Possible uses could be making lists like "My favorite articles of 2024" or "Great long-reads about money".

A number of question on the approach Readup could take with this:

- Should Readup only allow you to add articles that you've fully read with Readup?
- Should your (last?) Readup post be shown in the list, or should you be able to add an extra note only for the list?
- Naming the list seems like an essential feature. Should you be able to add a description too?
- Should it be possible to have lists that are private/unpublished (or in a draft state?), or lists that are only shared with followers?
- Is the order of articles in the list important?

Working with lists comes close to [[Classifying & tagging]], only a few elements like adding list-specific notes and order within a list make it potentially different.
