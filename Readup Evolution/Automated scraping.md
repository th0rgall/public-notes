When websites don't expose an [[Article intake from RSS feeds|RSS feed]], Readup could proactively seek out articles by scraping these websites.

Readup's parser was designed to detect article content and metadata in a generic way, but there is no parser for _article listings_. A new one could be designed, or this feature could go hand-in-hand with [[The Readup Librarian Role]] and the [[Collaborative article selector list]]: Readup would only scrape sites for which it can reliably extract articles.

A part of this problem is detecting whether a page contains an article, or not, which is a problem shared with the [[Auto-tracking in the extension|auto-tracker]].
