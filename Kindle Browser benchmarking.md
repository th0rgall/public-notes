## To check

**CSS**
- [ ] Media queries
- [ ] Can `background-color: transparent;` be used?
- [ ] Does `text-decoration`, see [this](Empirical%20Documentation%20for%20Kindle's%20Web%20Browser.md#^kindle-links)
- [ ] Does `pointer-events: none` work? Apparently a Safari 4 feature.

**JS**
- [ ] Can kindle know its own user agent from JS?
- [ ] Does the overlay hack affect background text? It seems to persist more, but that might be an illusion.
- [ ] Can Deno Fresh islands run on the Kindle? Or are the using unsupported Web Components?
- [ ] Can Preact in general run on the Kindle? (maybe with transpilation)
