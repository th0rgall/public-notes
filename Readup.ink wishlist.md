### Would be cool

**Complete/fix**
- [ ] When opening an article, ask to continue where we left off (now it just does it).

**Reader options**
- [ ] Allow font size adjustments
- [ ] Allow hiding/unhiding links (by actually removing them/changing their tags)
- [ ] Allow setting page scrolling & continuous scrolling
- [ ] While reading, show progress with a small line

**Platform**
- [ ] User can see past AOTD winners
- [ ] User can post an article in the reader
- [ ] User can post an article from a "..." menu on the article card
- [ ] Visitor can see comments at the bottom of the reader (always)
- [ ] Visitor can preview comments in a modal
- [ ] Non-kindle visitor can paste a URL to open
- [ ] Provide a reading history tab for users
- [ ] Anonymous reading history & progress is persisted (probably best locally)
- [ ] Anonymous comments are possible in a sideloaded system
- [ ] Alternative "tracker view" (like the tweakers.net home page) for a quicker overview - on all article lists 

**General**
- [ ] The reader/index contains a "What is this?" link on the top *for visitors only*, popping up a modal explaining Readup.ink
### Maybe later
- [ ] Figure out why images are completely missing
